/*Given two integer arrays A and B of size N each which represent values and weights associated with N items respectively.
Also given an integer C which represents knapsack capacity.
Find out the maximum value subset of A such that sum of the weights of this subset is smaller than or equal to C.
NOTE:
You cannot break an item, either pick the complete item, or donâ€™t pick it (0-1 property).
Example Input
Input 1:
 A = [60, 100, 120]
 B = [10, 20, 30]
 C = 50
Input 2:
 A = [10, 20, 30, 40]
 B = [12, 13, 15, 19]
 C = 10
Example Output
Output 1: 220
Output 2: 0
Example Explanation
Explanation 1:
 Taking items with weight 20 and 30 will give us the maximum value i.e 100 + 120 = 220
Explanation 2:
 Knapsack capacity is 10 but each item has weight greater than 10 so no items can be considered in the knapsack therefore answer is 0.*/

                              //if picked = A[i-1]+dp[i-1,w-B[i-1]]
                    dp[i,w] = Math.Max(dp[i-1,w],(A[i-1]+dp[i-1,w-B[i-1]]));
